Ratpack Lite project template
-----------------------------

You have just created a very basic Groovy Ratpack application. This is for
experienced users that know exactly what they want and get frustrated at
deleting a bunch files and directories that they don't want or need.

In this project you get:

* A Gradle build file
* A tiny home page at src/ratpack/public/index.html
* A routing file at src/ratpack/ratpack.groovy
* Reloading enabled via src/ratpack/config.groovy

That's it! You can start the basic app with

    gradle run

but it's up to you to add the bells, whistles, and meat of the application.
